# Problem:
# Write a method that takes a positive integer or zero, and converts it to a string representation.

# Test cases:
# integer_to_string(4321) == '4321'
# integer_to_string(0) == '0'
# integer_to_string(5000) == '5000'

# PEDAC

# any questions?

# input:
# integer - 0 or greater

# output:
# string - string representation of the integer

# rules:
  # Explicit requirements:
  # You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby, such as Integer#to_s, String(), Kernel#format, etc. Your method should do this the old-fashioned way and construct the string by analyzing and manipulating the number.

  #Implicit requirements:
  # 

# Algorithm:
# - reverse the previous method
# - change the values to strings and the keys to integers
# - rename the method param, digits array, etc.
