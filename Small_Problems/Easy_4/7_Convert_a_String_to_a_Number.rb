# Problem:
# Write a method that takes a String of digits, and returns the appropriate number as an integer. You may not use any of the standard conversion methods (String#to_i, Integer(), etc).

# Test cases:
# string_to_integer('4321') == 4321
# string_to_integer('570') == 570

# PEDAC

# any questions?

# input:
# string - a string of digits

# output:
# integer - the same digits that were input

# rules:
  # Explicit requirements:
  # Cannot use any conversion methods
  # assume all characters will be numeric

  #Implicit requirements:
  # Don't worry about accounting for empty strings

# Algorithm:
